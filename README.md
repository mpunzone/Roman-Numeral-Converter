# Roman Numeral Converter
This program is intended to convert roman numerals into the correct number.
**The currency rates are outdated and not accurate**

## Code to be Improved
Incorrect combination of roman numerals entered will create a crash rather than an error message. I would like to fix this with a do-while loop
  (do-while boolean is true, boolean will be correct combination).
Could add functions to make the switch statement cleaner.
